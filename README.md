## Context
We decided to port accelerant and all wacky stuff from Online Vs over to Kade Engine
and because Online vs is also made in another engine (Click team fusion 2.5)

Also Clickteam Fusion 2.5 sucks, and all those other ports don't actually use all the correct assets and have all the parts for the actual game, so we decided to do it
